# Incident Response Logs & Case Studies

This repository contains documentation of simulated security incidents and case studies. The goal of these logs is to demonstrate proficiency in the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle** (Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication & Recovery, Post-Incident Activity).

## Methodology
Each log follows a structured format to ensure clarity and professional documentation standards:
* **Executive Summary:** High-level overview for non-technical stakeholders.
* **The 5 W's:** Who, What, When, Where, Why (Root Cause Analysis).
* **Technical Details:** Attack vectors, IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), and payload analysis.
* **Remediation:** Recommended steps for containment and recovery based on industry best practices.
